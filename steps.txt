AMSIC steps 


INTRODUCTION:
Cadence Virtuoso is a widely used tool for schematic design, simulation, and layout of analog and digital circuits in VLSI design. This experiment involves the creation of a schematic in Cadence Virtuoso, simulation using ADE (Analog Design Environment), and plotting of output waveforms.

STEPS FOR EXECUTING IN CADENCE VIRTUOSO:
1. Setting Up the Environment:
Right-click and open the terminal.


Create a directory using the command:

 mkdir <directory_name>


Enter into your directory using:

 cd <directory_name>


Launch Virtuoso by typing:

 virtuoso &
 and press Enter. The Virtuoso window will open.



2. Creating a New Library:
In Virtuoso, go to File > New > Library.


Give a Library Name.


Attach the Technology File (e.g., gpdk180).


Click OK.



3. Creating a New Cell View (Schematic):
Go to File > New > Cell View.


Enter a Cell Name.


Select Schematic as the View Type.


Click OK.


Draw the required schematic in the opened schematic editor window.



4. Placing Components (Instances):
Press i (shortcut for Create > Instance).


Select Library (e.g., analogLib for basic components).


Choose the desired component (e.g., VDC, VPulse, Capacitor, etc.).


Set the parameters as per requirement:


For VDC: V = 1.8V


For VPulse:


V1 = 0V


V2 = 1.8V


Period = 20ns


Pulse Width = 10ns


Rise Time = Fall Time = 1ns


For Capacitor: C = 0.1pF


Click to place the components in the schematic.



5. Wiring the Circuit:
Press w (shortcut for Create > Wire (Narrow)).


Make all necessary connections.


Press L to add labels (if required).



6. Saving and Creating a Symbol:
Go to File > Check and Save to save the schematic.


For symbol generation:


Go to Create > Cellview > From Cellview.


Click OK.


Save the symbol view.



7. Simulation Setup (ADE - Analog Design Environment):
Go to Launch > ADE L.


In ADE window:


Go to Setup > Model Libraries.


Add the appropriate Technology File (e.g., gpdk180).



8. Setting Analysis:
Go to Analyses > Choose and set:


Transient Analysis:


Stop Time = 80ns


Accuracy = Moderate


DC Analysis:


Sweep Component = Vds (or as required)


Sweep Type = Linear


Start = 0V, Stop = 1.8V


Step Size = 0.01V



9. Plotting Outputs:
Go to Outputs > To Be Plotted > Select on Schematic and select the required nodes.


Go to Variables > Edit to set variable values (e.g., Vgs = 0.9V).


Go to Tools > Parametric Analysis to sweep variables (e.g., Vgs: 0 to 0.9V, step size 0.3V, linear mode).



10. Run Simulation:
Click on the Run button.


View the output waveforms in the Results window.




Post-Layout Simulation and Physical Design Flow in Cadence Virtuoso

I. Layout Design and Parasitic Extraction Flow
1️⃣ Creating the Layout:
In Virtuoso, go to Launch > Layout XL.


In the Create New File dialog:


Set View Name to Layout.


Click OK.


2️⃣ Generating Layout from Schematic:
In Layout XL window:


Go to Connectivity > Generate > All From Source.


Click OK.


Press Shift + F to refresh and display all layers.


3️⃣ Layout Editing:
Place components, routes, and pins:


Pins:


Go to Place > Pin.


For Vin → Left


For Vout → Right


For VDD → Top


For GND → Bottom


Click Apply after each placement.


Draw poly gates:


Go to Create > Shape > Path.


Connect gates as required.


For PMOS transistor layout:


Expand PR boundary by dragging (Click + Drag).


Press Esc when done.


Short Vdd, source, and substrate connections accordingly.


4️⃣ DRC (Design Rule Check):
Go to Assura > DRC:


Set Technology to gpdk180.


Click OK.


Verify there are no mismatches. If OK, proceed.



5️⃣ Parasitic Extraction (PEX):
Go to Calibre > Via > Via Definition (for via settings, e.g., M1 to P1).


Save.


Go to Assura > Run Quantus RC Extraction:


Output: Extracted View.


Extraction Type: RC.


Reference Node: GND.


HRCX: Disable.


Click OK.


After extraction, Close all windows.


In Virtuoso:


Go to File > Open > View.


Select au-extracted view for post-layout simulation.



II. Post-Layout Simulation Setup:
1️⃣ Shift+I for Parasitic Values:
In the au-extracted view, press Shift + I to check the RC parasitic values.


2️⃣ Simulation Setup:
In Virtuoso Window:


Go to Tools > Library Manager.


Open the test circuit schematic.


Go to File > New > Cellview.


Type: Configuration.


In the Create Configuration window:


Use Template: spectre.


Click OK.


In View: Set to schematic. Click OK.


In the ADEL (ADE L) Window:


Go to Session > Save State.


Select Save in Cellview option.


Click Apply and OK.


Click on Netlist and Run the simulation.



III. Final Steps:
Open the schematic and layout as needed.


In ADE:


Launch ADE > Load the previously saved state (cellview).


Run post-layout simulation.


View results and analyze the impact of parasitic effects (R & C values).



🌟 Notes & Best Practices:
✅ Always verify DRC and LVS before extraction.
 ✅ Use Extracted View (au-extracted) for post-layout simulation.
 ✅ Check for pin mismatches and connectivity errors during layout generation.
 ✅ Always Save your design state regularly in ADEL.
